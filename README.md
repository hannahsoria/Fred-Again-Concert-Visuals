# Fred-Again-Concert-Visuals

I wanted to create concert visuals for Fred Again for his album Actual Life 3. I chose this project because I love music and concerts and this artist. The goal was to create two screens: the concert visuals that a viewer would see, and the control panel that someone hidden from the crowd would use. I wanted a highly interactive set up so the control panel has buttons and sliders to control visuals. I also wanted the visuals to interact with the music so I used frequencies, amplitude, and waveform to dictate the movement of the visuals. Lastly, I wanted the visuals to be able to integrate into each other so you can set one visual, background, and text at a time creating a bunch of combinations. I initially started with using tone.js because I wanted to use an API new to me but after the first check in I switch to just P5.js because it worked the best with what I was aiming to do.
